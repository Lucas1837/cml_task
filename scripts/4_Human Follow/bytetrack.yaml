tracker_type: bytetrack

# Association thresholds â€” stricter to avoid false matches
track_high_thresh: 0.85     # Require higher confidence for first association
track_low_thresh: 0.05       # Require decent confidence even during occlusion
match_thresh: 0.8           # Keep high so mismatched objects aren't linked

# Score fusion helps, but only if your detector is good
fuse_score: True

# New track creation â€” require very confident detection before starting a track
new_track_thresh: 0.85

# Drop low-quality detections
min_box_area: 100           # Ignore tiny detections (often false positives)

# How long to keep a track without detection (in frames)
track_buffer: 90            # Lower from 180 to drop ghosts sooner
